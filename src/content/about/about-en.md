Hey there! I'm a Software Engineer currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at both Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the University of Amsterdam.

I love great design pattern and well-maintained code.
I am well acquainted with *backend*, *database* and *cloud technologies* and
occasionally study frontend frameworks.

In my free time, I love hiking 🥾, swimming 🏊, cooking 👨‍🍳 and watch movies 🎬.
There’s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn’t that kind of the point?
